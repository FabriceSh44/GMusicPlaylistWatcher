# GMusicPlaylistWatcher
I've discovered that I lost music in my playlist and I want to know which one.

Usage :

    PlaylistScraperRunner.py [path to config.ini]

Content of config.ini :

    [GmailAccountInfo]
    gmailEmail = *gmail account*
    gmailAppPassword = *app password*
    
    [Persistence]
    dumpFile = *dump file destination*
